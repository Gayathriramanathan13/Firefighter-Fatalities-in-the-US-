# Firefighter-Fatalities-in-the-US-
Some simple Visualizations and Analytics on data by the Federal Emergency Management Agency using R

I made this as a mini project in R for a peer review assignment for the coursera course Foundations of Strategic Business Analytics by ESSEC Business School.

The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/fema/firefighter-fatalities

It contains Name, rank, age and cause of death along with some other information about all the firefighter fatalities in the US since the year 2000

The R code is in  firefighteranalytics.R

Some important results of the project have been represented in a one page presentation as a picture in finalppt.PNG

database.csv is the dataset from FEMA
MyData.csv is the data with the year column included
Some of the visualizations generated have been uploaded as pictures as well
