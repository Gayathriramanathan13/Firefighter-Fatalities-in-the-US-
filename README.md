# Firefighter-Fatalities-in-the-US-
Some simple Visualizations and Analytics on data by the Federal Emergency Management Agency using R

I made this as a mini project in R for a peer review assignment for the coursera course Foundations of Strategic Business Analytics by ESSEC Business School.

The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/fema/firefighter-fatalities

It contains Name, rank, age and cause of death along with some other information about all the firefighter fatalities in the US since the year 2000

Some important results of the project have been represented in a one page presentation in pdf format.
